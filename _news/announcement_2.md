I recently participated in the annual Waterloo 10K race, and I must say, it was a fantastic experience. Despite my pace dropping significantly compared to last year, I still had a wonderful time.

The past couple of months have been incredibly busy for me as I've been preparing for my PhD defense, which left me with little time to train. Nevertheless, I managed to finish the race in 51:30 (unofficial time).

Running this race reminded me of the beauty of running and the joy it brings, regardless of the challenges along the way. I'm grateful for the experience and looking forward to more races in the future.
