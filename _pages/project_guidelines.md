## Project Guidelines  
 
The course project is an individual research project that will account for **25% of the final grade**. The project consists of:  
1. **Project Proposal** (at most **2 pages**) – due February 24 (11:59 PM)  
2. **Final Paper** (at most **8 pages**, in a **conference/journal format** of your choice) – due April 17 (11:59 PM)  

### Finding Relevant Literature  
To search for research papers, use **Google Scholar**. Most papers available online can be found there, and the majority of links are freely accessible. If you encounter paywalls, you should be able to access the papers through the **University’s library website** or while connected to the **University’s network**.
